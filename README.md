# API Gateway
## What is API Gateway for?

An API Gateway sits in front of your application(s) and/or services and manages the heavy lifting of authorisation, access control and throughput limiting to your services. Ideally, it should mean that you can focus on creating services instead of implementing management infrastructure. For example, if you have written a really awesome web service, and you want to make it public, integrating an API gateway is a faster, more secure route than writing your own authorisation middleware.

## Module 3

@xuxiangyu

public/API combination

A visual API combination system based on an open source project called SVGDragTree on github.
The system can combine a composite API by dragging and dropping atomic atom API, and the composite API can be registered into the API gateway to use.

### Install

#### Dependencies

1.angular
2.bootstrap
3.jquery
4.SDT

All js files are imported via the <script> tagï¼š

```
<script src="framework/jquery.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
<script src="framework/bootstrap.min.js"></script>
<script src="framework/angular.js"></script>
<script src="framework/SDT.js" type="text/javascript" defer="defer" charset="utf-8"></script>
```

### Run

The system can be run by opening "index.html" directly in the browser.

All types of APIs are displayed on the left side of the system. By dragging and dropping the node onto the canvas, click on the node to see all the properties of the API in the property setting area on the right, and it can be set. We can set the API to be synchronized or asynchronous execution, the implementation of the conditions, and so on.  click Save, the atomic API is set to be completed.

After setting up all the atomic APIs, click "Register" to register the combined combination API into the API gateway and use it.
